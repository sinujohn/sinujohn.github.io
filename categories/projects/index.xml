      <description>Just got to know that Google has came up with an handwriting recognition app - Google Handwriting Input.
And the good part is it has got Indian language support. Yay!!
But the bad part is that, it means the demise of my very own Thulika Keyboard. I had created it about 2 years back, and at that time there was no handwriting recognition app for any Indian language. I also had opensourced it, and have got requests from many to translate it to their language(Arabic, Hausa, Tamil to name a few) and some even have used it as part of their school/college projects.</description>

      <description>The WordCount is a trivial problem. What is the next best problem to tackle in Map Reduce? Something in which I can create my own Readers,Writables etc?
I kept wondering about this for some time. And then decided on what about a Search Engine? After all, the concepts of BigData originated at the house of the Search giant Google (from the papers they published about Map Reduce, BigTable etc.)
The first step was to implement an Inverted Index.</description>

      <description>Everyone is saying that the world is going the cloud way. Big Data, Analytics etc are today&amp;rsquo;s buzzwords. I used to wonder what is so special about the cloud? I read a bit about Hadoop, HBase (the NoSQL DB for Hadoop) etc and came to know about the Map Reduce Framework.
Map Reduce is a framework which helps us to write program for the cloud. It is a simple framework. The MapReduce version of the Hello World program for Hadoop is the WordCount program.</description>

      <description>Download the app from PlayStoreFind the source on GithubI have got Asianet Broadband connection and they require me to log in inorder to have an internet connection. In Android whenever I log in, Android keeps the browser app alive only for about 15 minutes. So I used to get logged out frequently. I was fed up of this, and because of a Developer&amp;rsquo;s itch, I developed an Android app - Immortal Login.</description>

      <description>Download the app from PlayStoreOn January 6th early morning(at about 3 AM), I created my Google Developer account, and published my first Android app - Thulika Keyboard- in the Play Store. Thulika Keyboard is a Handwriting recognition keyboard. It is the first app that brings handwriting recognition to an Indian Language(Malayalam for the time being!). User writes a single symbol, the app recognizes it and may give a possible list of suggestions.</description>

      <description>I just published my BTech miniproject - 8085sim, an 8085 simulator - on Sourceforge. Download it from here -http://sourceforge.net/projects/j8085sim/To get a valid name I added a &amp;lsquo;j&amp;rsquo; (short for Java) before the name, so it is now &amp;lsquo;j8085sim&amp;rsquo;.
This project is the result of about 5 weeks work by me and my team mates - Jinsmon Kurian and Deepu Devassy. Since the project demo is over, I believe this software should now be released.</description>

      <description>[UPDATE] The BSNL site design has been changed. So this program won&amp;rsquo;t work. I suppose only a small change is needed. Will try to update this post with the new link as soon as I find time for making necessary changes.[UPDATE]
What is the advantage of knowing a scripting language? It helps you to automate much of the boring tasks that you do on a day-to-day basis.
I was fed up of logging in, clicking a series of links and finally logging out from BSNL&amp;rsquo;s website (to be exact www.</description>

      <title>A Simple Videocutter</title>

      <description>I took out some time to create a simple videocutter and converter. Its actually just a front-end to ffmpeg, so you require ffmpeg to run it. Download videoCutter.
Why did I make this? Isn&amp;rsquo;t there any other good video converter or cutter? Oh ya, there are many. One of the good ones I have found is WinFF which is also a front-end to ffmpeg. But I don&amp;rsquo;t need all those complex functions to just convert a video.</description>
