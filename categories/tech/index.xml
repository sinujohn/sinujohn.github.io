      <description>Graph database is a great tool for mapping and traversing data with relationships. But doesn&amp;rsquo;t RDBMS have relationships - one-to-one, many-to-one etc? Why should we go for graphs? Its simple! Graph databases are best suited for those cases in which a graph comes to our mind instead of a table! I finished the online course on Neo4J two days back. Its a really simple graph database, and a great starting point to experiment graph databases.</description>

      <description>These days am a full time Java guy and the last time I coded in C++ was a little over an year ago. It was then I came across Boost library and I had heard that it packed a lot under the 5 letter library BOOST. Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t much used Boost, since it is being made part of the C++ standard, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a person who knew legacy C++ and so was always keen to know about Boost.</description>

      <description>Last day I managed to install Mac OS X Snaow Leopard 10.6 from the original retail DVD on my Dell Inspiron 1525. And to my astonishment it was pretty easy! - even though it took me 3 trials to get the hang of it :) After that I also updated it to SL version 10.6.5 :D
I followed the excellent guide available here. Take a print out of this guide and then do as follows:</description>

      <description>Last day, I happened to read about Android programming. I also tried their &amp;lsquo;Hello Android&amp;rsquo; program. I was really surprised (and happy) to know that Android programming is done in Java. That means I don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn any new languages. (Ofcourse we can program in C/C++, but thats a different case). But Android doesn&amp;rsquo;t use JVM to run these programs, instead it uses another VM called Dalvik VM. All android programs are under the control of this VM.</description>
