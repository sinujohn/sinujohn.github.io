      <description>It has been more than 6 months since I have blogged! I just shifted all my blog posts from my Wordpress blog to github. First I used Jekyll. Setting it up was a pain on my Windows PC. It needed Ruby and all those extra Rubygems. Then I settled for the Jekyll Docker image. That was better, but still generating the 70-odd-posts took so long everytime, and I knew it&amp;rsquo;ll take longer as the number of posts increase.</description>

      <description>I took a Developer Personality Test, conducted by DZone and it almost sums up what I am! Here&amp;rsquo;s the result I got:
 Here are your results! Independent vs Collaborative You are Independent Independent: You prefer to spend most of your time working in an isolated environment. You rarely want to collaborate because you have a better chance of solving problems on your own. If you do have to collaborate on the direction of a project, you dislike it when you have to defend your position or when others try to muddy your plans for the project.</description>

      <description>Just got to know that Google has came up with an handwriting recognition app - Google Handwriting Input.
And the good part is it has got Indian language support. Yay!!
But the bad part is that, it means the demise of my very own Thulika Keyboard. I had created it about 2 years back, and at that time there was no handwriting recognition app for any Indian language. I also had opensourced it, and have got requests from many to translate it to their language(Arabic, Hausa, Tamil to name a few) and some even have used it as part of their school/college projects.</description>

      <description>Just read this quote and I loved it:
 A beginning programmer writes her programs like an ant builds her hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure. Her programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but growing too big they fall apart.
Realizing this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of time thinking about structure. Her programs will be rigidly structured, like rock sculptures.</description>

      <description>These days all publishers are worried about their rights and the books are locked in, which is especially problematic in this digital age. Because unlike old days where we could share a book(hardcopy) which we bought, the new avatar of books - the e-books - are increasingly made to be under DRM, which means it stays only on one device or person. It can&amp;rsquo;t be shared with our friends even if we bought it with our hard earned cash.</description>

      <description>One of the best novels i have ever read - The Namesake. Loved it. Awesome work by Jhumpa Lahiri. Following is a quote I have found to be very inspiring
 &amp;ldquo;Do yourself a favor. Before it&amp;rsquo;s too late, without thinking too much about it first, pack a pillow and a blanket and see as much of the world as you can. You will not regret it. One day it will be too late.</description>

      <description>For almost two years I am living in Thiruvananthapuram(from March 2012 to be exact). And in these past few months I have travelled a lot in and around Thiruvananthapuram. Do I love this place? Yes and No. No? Why? Because this place lacks some sort of energy :( And yes because, there are a lot of places in and around Thiruvananthapuram, that provides some sort of ancient ambience. The backwaters like Muthalapozhi, the old buildings in the locality of Sree Padmanabha Swami Temple, the green hot spots of the city like Museum, Zoo and Kanakakunnu Palace (where I spent a lot of time in the weekends), the cultural hot spots like Nishagandhi Ground, Vyloppilli Samskriti Bhavan and the reader&amp;rsquo;s paradise - the Trivandrum Public Library(where I am a member and which made me a voracious reader once again) are some spots that I will definitly miss if I leave Thiruvananthapuram.</description>

      <description>A few days back I took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test at this site.
It says that I fall in INTP category.
From Myers-Briggs website, this is the description:
 INTP Seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them. Theoretical and abstract, interested more in ideas than in social interaction. Quiet, contained, flexible, and adaptable. Have unusual ability to focus in depth to solve problems in their area of interest.</description>

      <description>After what seemed like a long wait, I finally got my own Nexus7 2nd generation. Am now playing with the device and the first impression is IT IS AWESOME! A good friend of mine asked her family who was flying down from the US to get it for me. The device landed last week but I got my hands on it only today as I was on a vacation last week.</description>

      <description>I had been waiting for Google&amp;rsquo;s new Nexus 7 to be launched in India since it was released in late July. But seems like we Indians have to wait till year end:(
I created this meme since I can&amp;rsquo;t control the feeling any longer! aaahh.. now it feels better! :D ;)</description>

      <description>Today I was scanning through Malayala Manorama and then I saw an article which mentions my Thulika Kayboard. The article appears in Malayala Manorama of 14th August 2013 (Padippura section). I saw it in Thiruvananthapuram edition and don&amp;rsquo;t know whether other editions have it.
Here is the article:

      <description>Woke up today (actually yesterday as its past 12 midnight) to hear the news of Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo; death. The news about the death of a man whom I consider one of my role models actually left a kind of pain. Yup, I felt sad, as if someone I knew had died :(

Second fell on Newton

      <description>Just happened to read some &amp;lsquo;nerdy&amp;rsquo; jokes here.
My favourite ones (credit goes to their respective creators):
 there is a physicist, a biologist and a mathematician standing in front of a house. They see one man enter and two men leave.
The Physicist says, &amp;ldquo;Well there is obviously an unknown variable.&amp;rdquo; The Biologist says, &amp;ldquo;The man must have multiplied.&amp;rdquo;
The mathematician then looks at them both and says, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it happened but if one more person enters the house it will be empty.</description>

      <description>Decided to keep the default title for the first post.So &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; :)
Have started three/four blogs in the past. But couldn&amp;rsquo;t stick with them. Atleast i think i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t abandon this one. First reason is i got this blog with my name. And the second one is i really get a feeling that i should be sincere with this one. And the third one is &amp;hellip; hmm.. oops.. no third one.</description>
