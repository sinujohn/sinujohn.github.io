      <description>Sometime back I had to fiddle with Chef. I created some notes, posting it over here, so that I won&amp;rsquo;t loose it. Don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;ll be useful much to anyone else other than me :) Its basically a list of instructions that is scattered on their site.
So, anyone other than me, please ignore this post!

      <description>FasterXML Jackson is a great tool for converting objects to/from POJOs.
Its a great tool when we know the structure of JSON beforehand. But what if we don&amp;rsquo;t know that? In that case we can use a Map&amp;lt;String, Object&amp;gt; to store the unknown objects. Below two links provide useful info:

      <title>Tryst with Java 8!</title>

      <description>Java 8- it has been making headlines as the version which brings dramatic changes to Java. And I believe its true. I have been using Java 8 for the last few months and using Java 8 features has really brought changes in the way I write code and sometimes even the way I think about code!
Most of the changes is in the way we deal with Collections. And most of our daily life as a programmer revolves around manipulating or using Java Collections.</description>

      <description>Project Digitisation:I have decided to convert the notes that I have written into blogs :) This post and some posts that follow(about JPA) is part of that project.
There are several frameworks that are used for persisting objects in databases like JPA, Hibernate etc. (JPA is actually a specification. Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. Hibernate also has several extra features which are not specified by JPA).
This blog post mentions JDBC.</description>

      <description>Everyone is saying that the world is going the cloud way. Big Data, Analytics etc are today&amp;rsquo;s buzzwords. I used to wonder what is so special about the cloud? I read a bit about Hadoop, HBase (the NoSQL DB for Hadoop) etc and came to know about the Map Reduce Framework.
Map Reduce is a framework which helps us to write program for the cloud. It is a simple framework. The MapReduce version of the Hello World program for Hadoop is the WordCount program.</description>

      <description>I had been developing an Eclipse plugin for the last few weeks. Starting out the plugin development for a person with no idea of Eclipse plugin environment is very difficult. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll point out to the sources that helped me to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>AOP using AspectJ</title>
      <link>https://sinujohn.github.io/2013/05/09/aop-using-aspectj/</link>

      <description>Even though I had heard about AOP, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take it seriously. I thought it was meant for Enterprise applications usage like Transaction management, logging etc. But recently I was faced with a problem - how to know an Object&amp;rsquo;s state changes in Java. As you know state of an Object is its properties, so what I want is to know when the state changes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get what to do about it, and so posted in stackoverflow.</description>
