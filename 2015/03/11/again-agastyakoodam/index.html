            <div class="post-content">
                <p>When I completed the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-03-11-agastyakoodam-trekking %}">Agastyakoodam trek two years back</a>, I had decided to visit this awesome place again. It happened this year about two months back.</p>

<p>This time it was a group of 6 friends, including me. We were very much fortunate to get the entry permit on the first day of the trekking season. This gave us the forest in a much more pristine and virgin form. Because, as people start coming forest loses its glory!</p>

<p>There is not much to write as I have already explained about the trek in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-03-11-agastyakoodam-trekking %}">my previous blog entry</a>. But I&rsquo;ll highlight the differences that happened this year.</p>

<p>This year onwards, permit is being sanctioned online by the Kerala Forest Department. This saved us a lot of hassle and we got the permit for the first day itself(the season started on Jan 15th this time).</p>

<p>We started on January 15 and completed the trek in 3 days, unlike the last time where we did it in 2 days. The result? We enjoyed the trek much more. It was a relaxed trek and we enjoyed it to the core. We took ample photos and videos too, something we couldn&rsquo;t so last time because of time constraints :). I would recommend everyone to complete the trek in 3 days.</p>

<p>This time our gang was in a uniform (except one - he could make it only at the last moment, and so couldn&rsquo;t have the luxury of being in our uniform). See our uniform for yourself. Bhakti exploding :D</p>

<p><img src="/assets/agastya4.jpg" alt="The Five" /></p>

<p>In fact, the forest warden in the base camp told us seeing our uniform that we had immense Bhakti inside us :D Little did he know that it was just a show off. Any way, this uniform was one of our best decisions. Trekking wearing this attire was the most comfortable thing!</p>

<p>So here is the trip in short - we started on Jan 15th morning at about 11:30 (we reached their late) and reached the base camp by 6 PM. The next morning we started the ascend to the peak at about 7 in the morning. This time since we were not at all in a hurry, we took enough time in enjoying each step ;). We reached the top at 2 PM! (thats&rsquo;s too late by any standard, they want you to start the downward trek by 2:45PM max). Unlike last time, it was not at all windy, also it was too hot at the top. We started the downward journey by 2:30PM and reached the base camp by about 5:30PM (ya, downward journey was completed pretty quickly). We rested off the night. Next day morning, our departure was delayed by unexpected rains. So we could only start by 9 AM. We reached forest outpost by about 3:30PM. And thus our trek was done.</p>

<p>We had tracked our journey with GPS. I&rsquo;ll update this post once I get the track details from my friend.</p>

<p>Keep Travelling :) Enjoy the world. :) Don&rsquo;t disturb what&rsquo;s left off the forest and don&rsquo;t leave any traces :)</p>
