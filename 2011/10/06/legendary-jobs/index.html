<p>I am not a user of Apple products. But I have used them though. Its not from the Apple-user perspective that I like this man. Its his passion, his determination, the innovation he led, how he made products that were superhit, how he survived even after being thrown out of Apple (the creation of NeXT and Pixar), and his return to a failing Apple only to make it the Most Valuable Company in this world that makes him a Legend.</p>
<p>A true visionary whom Apple fanatics call iGod! Spend much of my free time today reading articles about him. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This man has become the coverpage of Time several times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! His message to the students was &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. It was one of the most inspirational speech ever. A quote from that</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was the life of Jobs that I liked much more than these products. Few could actually maintain their head after being thrown out of a company they founded. But here is a man, who continued his legacy to other non-similar areas and redefined success. The Pixar gave us some of the best animation films. And NeXT eventhough wasn&rsquo;t successful became the foundation for what is todays Mac OS X and iOS. (I really hate that NeXT Objective C crap though!)</p>
<p>Ya, Jobs you definitely touched a lot of human lives.. as some say you are the Michael Jackson of technology. Hats off to you</p>
