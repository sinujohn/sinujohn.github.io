      <description>Just got to know that Google has came up with an handwriting recognition app - Google Handwriting Input.
And the good part is it has got Indian language support. Yay!!
But the bad part is that, it means the demise of my very own Thulika Keyboard. I had created it about 2 years back, and at that time there was no handwriting recognition app for any Indian language. I also had opensourced it, and have got requests from many to translate it to their language(Arabic, Hausa, Tamil to name a few) and some even have used it as part of their school/college projects.</description>

      <description>After what seemed like a long wait, I finally got my own Nexus7 2nd generation. Am now playing with the device and the first impression is IT IS AWESOME! A good friend of mine asked her family who was flying down from the US to get it for me. The device landed last week but I got my hands on it only today as I was on a vacation last week.</description>

      <description>Today I was scanning through Malayala Manorama and then I saw an article which mentions my Thulika Kayboard. The article appears in Malayala Manorama of 14th August 2013 (Padippura section). I saw it in Thiruvananthapuram edition and don&amp;rsquo;t know whether other editions have it.
Here is the article:

      <description>The developer of Encog library, Jeff Heaton, tweeted about my first Android app - Thulika Keyboard. Someone wrote a nice Android handwriting app with #encog. https://t.co/vd2JpTrR

      <description>Download the app from PlayStore
Find the source on Github I have got Asianet Broadband connection and they require me to log in inorder to have an internet connection. In Android whenever I log in, Android keeps the browser app alive only for about 15 minutes. So I used to get logged out frequently. I was fed up of this, and because of a Developer&amp;rsquo;s itch, I developed an Android app - Immortal Login.</description>

      <description>Download the app from PlayStore On January 6th early morning(at about 3 AM), I created my Google Developer account, and published my first Android app - Thulika Keyboard - in the Play Store. Thulika Keyboard is a Handwriting recognition keyboard. It is the first app that brings handwriting recognition to an Indian Language(Malayalam for the time being!). User writes a single symbol, the app recognizes it and may give a possible list of suggestions.</description>

      <title>Training the Thulika Keyboard</title>

      <description>Before you read :
Indian languages use complex script unlike English letters. Each English letter is composed of a single Unicode letter. But each letter of Indian languages may be composed of more than one Unicode letters.
The decomposition is as follows: LetterCode + modifyingSymbolCode
Eg: ക്രൊ = ( ക + ്ര + ൊ )
So as you see the code that comes first(ക) need not be the first letter that the user writes(െ).</description>

      <title>Android OpenGL ES2.0 Template</title>

      <description>Learning OpenGLES 2.0 is easier on Android than on iOS because we can directly focus on OpenGLES implementation rather than wasting time on making the EGL bingings working properly. EGL stuffs are taken care of by android.opengl.GLSurfaceView.
OpenGL ES2.0 API is provided by &amp;lsquo;android.opengl.GLES20&amp;rsquo; package.
The naming convention sticks to the C version. Functions are implemented as static in GLES20 package. So they can be called like GLES20.function_name(). For example, the mappings are as follows from C to the Android Java version:</description>

      <description>Last day, I happened to read about Android programming. I also tried their &amp;lsquo;Hello Android&amp;rsquo; program. I was really surprised (and happy) to know that Android programming is done in Java. That means I don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn any new languages. (Ofcourse we can program in C/C++, but thats a different case). But Android doesn&amp;rsquo;t use JVM to run these programs, instead it uses another VM called Dalvik VM. All android programs are under the control of this VM.</description>
