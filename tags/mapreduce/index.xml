      <description>The WordCount is a trivial problem. What is the next best problem to tackle in Map Reduce? Something in which I can create my own Readers,Writables etc?
I kept wondering about this for some time. And then decided on what about a Search Engine? After all, the concepts of BigData originated at the house of the Search giant Google (from the papers they published about Map Reduce, BigTable etc.)
The first step was to implement an Inverted Index.</description>

      <description>Everyone is saying that the world is going the cloud way. Big Data, Analytics etc are today&amp;rsquo;s buzzwords. I used to wonder what is so special about the cloud? I read a bit about Hadoop, HBase (the NoSQL DB for Hadoop) etc and came to know about the Map Reduce Framework.
Map Reduce is a framework which helps us to write program for the cloud. It is a simple framework. The MapReduce version of the Hello World program for Hadoop is the WordCount program.</description>
