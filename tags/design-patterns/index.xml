      <description>Classification: Behavioral patterns Description : Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.
This pattern is sometimes referred to as Listeners in some frameworks.
Read about the pattern here. The code sample can be found in my git repo.
In the example code I have done, there is a city, as with all cities many things can go wrong in a city.</description>

      <description>Classification: Creational Pattern Description : Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
Whenever I hear about Singleton &amp;lsquo;Forever Alone&amp;rsquo; troll face comes to my mind ;)
In Singleton pattern, there will be only one object and wherever we want to use this class, this only object will be used. While creating this, we have to ensure that no more than one object is created for this class.</description>

      <title>Proxy Pattern</title>
      <link>https://sinujohn.github.io/2013/06/09/proxy-pattern/</link>

      <description>Classification: Structural Pattern(Proxy), Creational Pattern(Lazy Initialization)
Find the code example here.
In this pattern, we create a proxy for the original class that we are trying to use. This class will have all the methods(which we are interested in) of the original class and may or may not have extra methods. When we say proxy has the methods of original object, we mean the method signature. So using proxy object will be similar to using the real object.</description>

      <description>I had been reading about Design Patterns a while ago, and later dropped it after reading a few designs for reasons unknown. I carried on with my programming after that. Now when I look at the code that I&amp;rsquo;ve written(after reading the Design Patterns) I can see that I have unknowingly put some of the Design Patterns I had read about into the code I have done! Wow! :) Since it has helped me to code better I have decided to learn/revise atleast one new pattern once in a few days(or weeks for that matter ;) as am a bit lazy!</description>
