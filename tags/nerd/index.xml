      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just happened to read some &amp;lsquo;nerdy&amp;rsquo; jokes &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f3yax/whats_your_favorite_nerdy_joke/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite ones (credit goes to their respective creators):
&lt;blockquote&gt;there is a physicist, a biologist and a mathematician standing in front of a house. They see one man enter and two men leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Physicist says, &amp;ldquo;Well there is obviously an unknown variable.&amp;rdquo; The Biologist says, &amp;ldquo;The man must have multiplied.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematician then looks at them both and says, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it happened but if one more person enters the house it will be empty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A wife asks her husband, who is a software engineer: &#34;Could you please go shopping for me and buy 1 carton of milk. And if they have eggs, get 6!&#34; A short time later the husband comes back with 6 cartons of milk. The wife asks him why the hell did he buy 6 cartons of milk??? He: &#34;They had eggs&#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
________________________________________________________
&lt;blockquote&gt;An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar.

The first asks for a beer. The second asks for half a beer. The third asks for a quarter beer. The fourth is begins to order an eighth of a beer but the bartender cuts him off.

&#34;You&#39;re all idiots.&#34;

He pours two beers and goes to help other customers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;_________________________________________________&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two atoms are walking(?) along.

First atom: I think I&#39;ve lost an electron.

Second atom: Really? An electron? Are you sure?

First atom: Yeah.. I&#39;m positive!
