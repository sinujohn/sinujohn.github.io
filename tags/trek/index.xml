      <description>When I completed the Agastyakoodam trek two years back, I had decided to visit this awesome place again. It happened this year about two months back.
This time it was a group of 6 friends, including me. We were very much fortunate to get the entry permit on the first day of the trekking season. This gave us the forest in a much more pristine and virgin form. Because, as people start coming forest loses its glory!</description>

      <description>About two months back, me and a friend of mine went for trekking at Skandagiri Hills. Its about 75km from Bangalore near to Nandi Hills.Â  We started on my Yamaha Fz at about 2:30AM and reached there by 4.30AM. The place has got a few locals who are waiting there to get hold of your money in the form of parking and acting as guide! We parked (gave the guy Rs20/30 just to make sure he don&#39;t destroy my bike) and dismissed the idea of having a guide.</description>

      <description>On 2nd of March, we (a group of 10 friends) went onto the famous Agastyakoodam (or Agastyarkoodam as some call it that way). It is the second tallest hill in the Western Ghats. The tallest one is Anamudi. The only way to reach the top of Agastyakoodam is a 24km trek (although forest gaurds say it is only 18km). Of this only the last 6km include the flight to the hill.</description>
