      <description>I took a Developer Personality Test, conducted by DZone and it almost sums up what I am! Here&amp;rsquo;s the result I got:
Here are your results! Independent vs Collaborative You are Independent Independent: You prefer to spend most of your time working in an isolated environment. You rarely want to collaborate because you have a better chance of solving problems on your own. If you do have to collaborate on the direction of a project, you dislike it when you have to defend your position or when others try to muddy your plans for the project.</description>

      <description>A few days back I took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test at this site.
It says that I fall in INTP category.
From Myers-Briggs website, this is the description: &amp;gt;### INTP &amp;gt;Seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them. Theoretical and abstract, interested more in ideas than in social interaction. Quiet, contained, flexible, and adaptable. Have unusual ability to focus in depth to solve problems in their area of interest.</description>
