      <description>When I completed the [Agastyakoodam trek two years back]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-03-11-agastyakoodam-trekking %}), I had decided to visit this awesome place again. It happened this year about two months back.
This time it was a group of 6 friends, including me. We were very much fortunate to get the entry permit on the first day of the trekking season. This gave us the forest in a much more pristine and virgin form.</description>

      <description>On 2nd of March, we (a group of 10 friends) went onto the famous Agastyakoodam(or Agastyarkoodam as some call it that way). It is the second tallest hill in the Western Ghats. The tallest one is Anamudi. The only way to reach the top of Agastyakoodam is a 24km trek (although forest gaurds say it is only 18km). Of this only the last 6km include the flight to the hill. The remaining 18km(or 12km if you believe the forest gaurds) is through dense forests which comprise the Agastyakoodam Biosphere reserve.</description>

      <description>We planned to start to Kanyakumari from Thiruvanathapuram(tvm) by 5 AM so that we could see the sun rise at India&amp;rsquo;s southern-most tip. But as usual, we got delayed! And we left by about 5.45AM. Our rides consisted of my Fz and a friend&amp;rsquo;s Hunk. There were 4 of us - Arun Elias, Dhanoop Bhaskar, Basil Kuriakose and myself.
We rode through Kanyakumari-Panvel road. We reached Neyyattinkara and had breakfast from a small hotel.</description>
