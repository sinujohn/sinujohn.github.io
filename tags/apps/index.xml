      <description>Just got to know that Google has came up with an handwriting recognition app - Google Handwriting Input.
And the good part is it has got Indian language support. Yay!!
But the bad part is that, it means the demise of my very own Thulika Keyboard. I had created it about 2 years back, and at that time there was no handwriting recognition app for any Indian language. I also had opensourced it, and have got requests from many to translate it to their language(Arabic, Hausa, Tamil to name a few) and some even have used it as part of their school/college projects.</description>

      <description>Download the app from PlayStoreFind the source on GithubI have got Asianet Broadband connection and they require me to log in inorder to have an internet connection. In Android whenever I log in, Android keeps the browser app alive only for about 15 minutes. So I used to get logged out frequently. I was fed up of this, and because of a Developer&amp;rsquo;s itch, I developed an Android app - Immortal Login.</description>

      <description>Download the app from PlayStoreOn January 6th early morning(at about 3 AM), I created my Google Developer account, and published my first Android app - Thulika Keyboard- in the Play Store. Thulika Keyboard is a Handwriting recognition keyboard. It is the first app that brings handwriting recognition to an Indian Language(Malayalam for the time being!). User writes a single symbol, the app recognizes it and may give a possible list of suggestions.</description>

      <description>Before you read :Indian languages use complex script unlike English letters. Each English letter is composed of a single Unicode letter. But each letter of Indian languages may be composed of more than one Unicode letters.
The decomposition is as follows: LetterCode + modifyingSymbolCode
Eg: ക്രൊ = ( ക + ്ര + ൊ )
So as you see the code that comes first(ക) need not be the first letter that the user writes(െ).</description>
