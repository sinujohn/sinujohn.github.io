      <description>I was searching for good JavaScript resources and then stumbled onto this guy - Douglas Crockford. Douglas Crockford is Yahoo!&#39;s JavaScript architect. He is also the creator of JSON and the author of the book which I am reading now - Javascript: the good parts. He is one of the most authoritative person to talk about JavaScript.
I found his talks on JavaScript and just finished watching the first part.</description>

      <description>I had been learning about AngularJS last week. Even though Javascript still causes my stomach to turn upside down, I have decided to make myself familiar with it. I completed the Codeschool classes on it. And then I stumbled onto this awesome series of videos by David Mosher. Its superb. Watch it over here. Parts 1, 2 and 3 are enough to get you up and running.
