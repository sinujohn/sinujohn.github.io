      <description>For almost two years I am living in Thiruvananthapuram(from March 2012 to be exact). And in these past few months I have travelled a lot in and around Thiruvananthapuram. Do I love this place? Yes and No. No? Why? Because this place lacks some sort of energy :( And yes because, there are a lot of places in and around Thiruvananthapuram, that provides some sort of ancient ambience. The backwaters like Muthalapozhi, the old buildings in the locality of Sree Padmanabha Swami Temple, the green hot spots of the city like Museum, Zoo and Kanakakunnu Palace (where I spent a lot of time in the weekends), the cultural hot spots like Nishagandhi Ground, Vyloppilli Samskriti Bhavan and the reader&amp;rsquo;s paradise - the Trivandrum Public Library (where I am a member and which made me a voracious reader once again) are some spots that I will definitly miss if I leave Thiruvananthapuram.</description>
