      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days am a full time Java guy and the last time I coded in C++ was a little over an year ago. It was then I came across Boost library and I had heard that it packed a lot under the 5 letter library BOOST. Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t much used Boost, since it is being made part of the C++ standard, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a person who knew legacy C++ and so was always keen to know about Boost. And thats when I came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packtpub.com/boost-cplusplus-application-development-cookbook/book&#34;&gt;this book on Boost&lt;/a&gt;. Its a cookbook style book which helps people who already know C++ and want to learn Boost. Here is my review on GoodReads :&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a style=&#34;float:left;padding-right:20px;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18430596-boost-c-application-development-cookbook&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Boost C++ Application Development Cookbook&#34; src=&#34;https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1390102286m/18430596.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18430596-boost-c-application-development-cookbook&#34;&gt;Boost C++ Application Development Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7250001.Antony_Polukhin&#34;&gt;Antony Polukhin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/829027786&#34;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those who want to use C++ in production will one day or other come across Boost Library. Being a coder who doesn&amp;rsquo;t use C++ as a primary language, but who wish to keep abreast of whats happening in the industry (and C++ is still not dead!), I always wanted to learn Boost. I had in fact downloaded boost about an year back, but haven&amp;rsquo;t used it much. A good tutorial was missing. And this cookbook definitely fills the void. It is not a beginners book who want to study C++. But its definitely an introduction to Boost. The author has made the cookbook way to give a very good introduction to Boost library.
What I liked: It is straight to the point. A no-nonsense book.
Boost is a large library and some of the it have been added in C++11. And some it is being said to be part of C++14. This itself tells that Boost is a library which every C++ programmer should be familiar of. And this cookbook is really a starting point to learning it. I should say that it is only the tip of the ice-berg, but it should make you capable of digging deep into the ice-berg&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Namesake</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best novels i have ever read - The Namesake. Loved it. Awesome work by Jhumpa Lahiri. Following is a quote I have found to be very inspiring&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&#34;Do yourself a favor. Before it&#39;s too late, without thinking too much about it first, pack a pillow and a blanket and see as much of the world as you can. You will not regret it. One day it will be too late.&#34;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have started reading her another book - &amp;ldquo;The interpreter of maladies&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thrown into the ebook bandwagon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have started reading a lot of books. And by recently, I mean the last two weeks. And these books are not ordinary paperback books, but they are ebooks which I read on my Nexus 7. I never thought I will be reading ebooks - I thought this was just a hype and ebooks can&#39;t just give you that feel that you get while reading a hardcopy of the book, I always thought I will miss the turning of pages, the smell of new books, the look of old books, but alas, I haven&#39;t started to miss much of these!&lt;br /&gt;Its true, sometimes it feels mechanical, but you can always go back!&lt;br /&gt;The books that I am reading now are: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Namesake&#34;&gt;The Namesake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packtpub.com/learning-libgdx-game-development/book&#34;&gt;Learning Libgdx Game Development&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer&#34;&gt;The Passionate Programmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer&#34;&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
