      <description>These days am a full time Java guy and the last time I coded in C++ was a little over an year ago. It was then I came across Boost library and I had heard that it packed a lot under the 5 letter library BOOST. Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t much used Boost, since it is being made part of the C++ standard, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a person who knew legacy C++ and so was always keen to know about Boost.</description>

      <description>Recently I created a program which can send a file to a server in several packets using HTTP POST. I also created a servlet(in fact, my first servlet!) to receive these file parts and then create a file using them. Download it. The program &#39;client.c&#39; sends a file to the server as mentioned in small parts - 100KB, but you can change the size (set value in SIZELIMIT). The program uses Curl library to send the file using HTTP POST.</description>

      <description>GCC - GNU Compiler Collection
From GCC manual - When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.
Compile and Link a simple program: gcc -o hello.out hello.c  This creates an executable &amp;lsquo;hello.out&amp;rsquo; from file &amp;lsquo;hello.c&amp;rsquo; -o specifies the output file.
Specify Language: Create a C file and save it as &amp;lsquo;hello.cpp&amp;rsquo;.
gcc -o hello.out hello.cpp  This results in an error as gcc tries to perform C++ compilation(assumed from the extension .</description>
