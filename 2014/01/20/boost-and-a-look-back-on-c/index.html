            <div class="post-content">
                <p>These days am a full time Java guy and the last time I coded in C++ was a little over an year ago. It was then I came across Boost library and I had heard that it packed a lot under the 5 letter library BOOST. Even though I haven&rsquo;t much used Boost, since it is being made part of the C++ standard, I don&rsquo;t want to be a person who knew legacy C++ and so was always keen to know about Boost. And thats when I came across <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/boost-cplusplus-application-development-cookbook/book">this book on Boost</a>. Its a cookbook style book which helps people who already know C++ and want to learn Boost. Here is my review on GoodReads :<em>

<p>My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/829027786">5 of 5 stars</a></p>

<p>All those who want to use C++ in production will one day or other come across Boost Library. Being a coder who doesn&rsquo;t use C++ as a primary language, but who wish to keep abreast of whats happening in the industry (and C++ is still not dead!), I always wanted to learn Boost. I had in fact downloaded boost about an year back, but haven&rsquo;t used it much. A good tutorial was missing. And this cookbook definitely fills the void. It is not a beginners book who want to study C++. But its definitely an introduction to Boost. The author has made the cookbook way to give a very good introduction to Boost library.
What I liked: It is straight to the point. A no-nonsense book.
Boost is a large library and some of the it have been added in C++11. And some it is being said to be part of C++14. This itself tells that Boost is a library which every C++ programmer should be familiar of. And this cookbook is really a starting point to learning it. I should say that it is only the tip of the ice-berg, but it should make you capable of digging deep into the ice-berg</p>
