      <description>Preface Spring Cloud Stream provides a framework to implement messaging in a clean way. The new version 3 brings functional paradigm to the Spring Cloud Stream framework where previously the annotations were used for the same. Docs explain it way better, but I will provide a succint way to get started. Read this after going through the docs. In this blog, I chose Kafka as the message broker.
Getting Started Add Dependencies  Cloud Stream Kafka  Adding Cloud Stream, lets us create Beans of type Function, Consumer or Supplier.</description>

      <description>Flashback Long back, I was a hardcore Linux enthusiast having been brain washed by the FSF folks. I have long been out of that hate mindset where you are supposed to hate everything which is not free (FSF Free).
Still I love the *nix env and it is one of the best ways a developer can be productive. I had used Mac in the past and the developer friendliness that ecosystem offers is top notch.</description>

      <description>I had been looking for ways on how to unit test sending out emails via SMTP server. As with all other problems, there are a bunch of options for this. But most of them are not embeddable which means I have to start them and stop them outside my code. I was looking for something very simple. Something thats embeddable and provides just the bare minimum functionality that I need like asserting whether mails have been send (without actually sending them ofcourse!</description>

      <description>It has been more than 6 months since I have blogged! I just shifted all my blog posts from my Wordpress blog to github. First I used Jekyll. Setting it up was a pain on my Windows PC. It needed Ruby and all those extra Rubygems. Then I settled for the Jekyll Docker image. That was better, but still generating the 70-odd-posts took so long everytime, and I knew it&amp;rsquo;ll take longer as the number of posts increase.</description>

      <description>Sometime back I had to fiddle with Chef. I created some notes, posting it over here, so that I won&amp;rsquo;t loose it. Don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;ll be useful much to anyone else other than me :) Its basically a list of instructions that is scattered on their site.
So, anyone other than me, please ignore this post!

      <description>Adding non standard, non-maven, custom jars in a maven project is a common issue. And this SO post is usually the first googled result. But here is another easier way: Use addjars-maven-plugin. Its easier, no need to run any script, no installing of jars manually, or use the dreaded system scope. Using this also means, the shaded uber jar that gets created will contain the custom jars.
How to use?</description>

      <description>I took a Developer Personality Test, conducted by DZone and it almost sums up what I am! Here&amp;rsquo;s the result I got:
 Here are your results! Independent vs Collaborative You are Independent Independent: You prefer to spend most of your time working in an isolated environment. You rarely want to collaborate because you have a better chance of solving problems on your own. If you do have to collaborate on the direction of a project, you dislike it when you have to defend your position or when others try to muddy your plans for the project.</description>

      <description>Just got to know that Google has came up with an handwriting recognition app - Google Handwriting Input.
And the good part is it has got Indian language support. Yay!!
But the bad part is that, it means the demise of my very own Thulika Keyboard. I had created it about 2 years back, and at that time there was no handwriting recognition app for any Indian language. I also had opensourced it, and have got requests from many to translate it to their language(Arabic, Hausa, Tamil to name a few) and some even have used it as part of their school/college projects.</description>

      <description>Just read this quote and I loved it:
 A beginning programmer writes her programs like an ant builds her hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure. Her programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but growing too big they fall apart.
Realizing this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of time thinking about structure. Her programs will be rigidly structured, like rock sculptures.</description>

      <description>I had figured out how to authenticate users using Facebook a couple of months back. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t document it, and so yesterday I again wasted my time figuring it out. So here is the brain dumb so that I won&amp;rsquo;t waste my time again at the time of need. :)
Prerequisite: Create an appusing Facebook Developer account and create the necessary App ID and App Secret keys.
If you are testing out your app and you are running it locally, the site URL should be something like http://localhost:8090/</description>

      <description>When I completed the [Agastyakoodam trek two years back]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-03-11-agastyakoodam-trekking %}), I had decided to visit this awesome place again. It happened this year about two months back.
This time it was a group of 6 friends, including me. We were very much fortunate to get the entry permit on the first day of the trekking season. This gave us the forest in a much more pristine and virgin form.</description>

      <description>Graph database is a great tool for mapping and traversing data with relationships. But doesn&amp;rsquo;t RDBMS have relationships - one-to-one, many-to-one etc? Why should we go for graphs? Its simple! Graph databases are best suited for those cases in which a graph comes to our mind instead of a table! I finished the online course on Neo4J two days back. Its a really simple graph database, and a great starting point to experiment graph databases.</description>

      <description>FasterXML Jackson is a great tool for converting objects to/from POJOs.
Its a great tool when we know the structure of JSON beforehand. But what if we don&amp;rsquo;t know that? In that case we can use a Map&amp;lt;String, Object&amp;gt; to store the unknown objects. Below two links provide useful info:

      <description>Java 8- it has been making headlines as the version which brings dramatic changes to Java. And I believe its true. I have been using Java 8 for the last few months and using Java 8 features has really brought changes in the way I write code and sometimes even the way I think about code!
Most of the changes is in the way we deal with Collections. And most of our daily life as a programmer revolves around manipulating or using Java Collections.</description>

      <description>These days all publishers are worried about their rights and the books are locked in, which is especially problematic in this digital age. Because unlike old days where we could share a book(hardcopy) which we bought, the new avatar of books - the e-books - are increasingly made to be under DRM, which means it stays only on one device or person. It can&amp;rsquo;t be shared with our friends even if we bought it with our hard earned cash.</description>

      <description>To use SLF4J and logback together, add the following to pom.xml:
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.slf4j&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;slf4j-api&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.7.5&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;ch.qos.logback&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;logback-classic&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.0.13&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;runtime&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;junit&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;junit&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;3.8.1&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;test&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; Now SLF4J&amp;rsquo;s logger can be used:import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; .... private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class); ... logger.debug(&amp;quot;Mandatory fields are missing&amp;quot;); If while running this in Eclipse or in console, it complains of some missing configuration, add thisto pom.xml:
&amp;lt;build&amp;gt; &amp;lt;pluginManagement&amp;gt; &amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt; &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.</description>

      <description>These days am a full time Java guy and the last time I coded in C++ was a little over an year ago. It was then I came across Boost library and I had heard that it packed a lot under the 5 letter library BOOST. Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t much used Boost, since it is being made part of the C++ standard, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a person who knew legacy C++ and so was always keen to know about Boost.</description>

      <description>One of the best novels i have ever read - The Namesake. Loved it. Awesome work by Jhumpa Lahiri. Following is a quote I have found to be very inspiring
 &amp;ldquo;Do yourself a favor. Before it&amp;rsquo;s too late, without thinking too much about it first, pack a pillow and a blanket and see as much of the world as you can. You will not regret it. One day it will be too late.</description>

      <description>For almost two years I am living in Thiruvananthapuram(from March 2012 to be exact). And in these past few months I have travelled a lot in and around Thiruvananthapuram. Do I love this place? Yes and No. No? Why? Because this place lacks some sort of energy :( And yes because, there are a lot of places in and around Thiruvananthapuram, that provides some sort of ancient ambience. The backwaters like Muthalapozhi, the old buildings in the locality of Sree Padmanabha Swami Temple, the green hot spots of the city like Museum, Zoo and Kanakakunnu Palace (where I spent a lot of time in the weekends), the cultural hot spots like Nishagandhi Ground, Vyloppilli Samskriti Bhavan and the reader&amp;rsquo;s paradise - the Trivandrum Public Library(where I am a member and which made me a voracious reader once again) are some spots that I will definitly miss if I leave Thiruvananthapuram.</description>

      <description>A few days back I took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test at this site.
It says that I fall in INTP category.
From Myers-Briggs website, this is the description:
 INTP Seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them. Theoretical and abstract, interested more in ideas than in social interaction. Quiet, contained, flexible, and adaptable. Have unusual ability to focus in depth to solve problems in their area of interest.</description>

A good friend of mine asked her family who was flying down from the US to get it for me. The device landed last week but I got my hands on it only today as I was on a vacation last week.</description>

@Column(name = &amp;quot;EMP_NAME&amp;quot;) private String name; //getters and setters  }
 this maps to Table: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EMP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  | EMP_ID (PK) | EMP_NAME | |_____________|__________|
 JPA automatically maps &#39;int&#39; to &#39;NUMBER&#39; and &#39;String&#39; to &#39;CHAR&#39; or &#39;VARCHAR&#39;. But it cannot automatically convert Date or Time datatypes. So we need to specify the Temporal type to be used.

      <description>Project Digitisation:I have decided to convert the notes that I have written into blogs :) This post and some posts that follow(about JPA) is part of that project.
There are several frameworks that are used for persisting objects in databases like JPA, Hibernate etc. (JPA is actually a specification. Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. Hibernate also has several extra features which are not specified by JPA).
This blog post mentions JDBC.</description>

      <description>The WordCount is a trivial problem. What is the next best problem to tackle in Map Reduce? Something in which I can create my own Readers,Writables etc?
I kept wondering about this for some time. And then decided on what about a Search Engine? After all, the concepts of BigData originated at the house of the Search giant Google (from the papers they published about Map Reduce, BigTable etc.)
The first step was to implement an Inverted Index.</description>

      <description>Everyone is saying that the world is going the cloud way. Big Data, Analytics etc are today&amp;rsquo;s buzzwords. I used to wonder what is so special about the cloud? I read a bit about Hadoop, HBase (the NoSQL DB for Hadoop) etc and came to know about the Map Reduce Framework.
Map Reduce is a framework which helps us to write program for the cloud. It is a simple framework. The MapReduce version of the Hello World program for Hadoop is the WordCount program.</description>

      <description>Classification: Behavioral patterns Description : Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.
This pattern is sometimes referred to as Listeners in some frameworks.
Read about the pattern here. The code sample can be found in my git repo.
In the example code I have done, there is a city, as with all cities many things can go wrong in a city.</description>

      <description>Classification: Creational Pattern Description : Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
Whenever I hear about Singleton &amp;lsquo;Forever Alone&amp;rsquo; troll face comes to my mind ;)
In Singleton pattern, there will be only one object and wherever we want to use this class, this only object will be used. While creating this, we have to ensure that no more than one object is created for this class.</description>

      <guid>https://sinujohn.github.io/2013/06/09/proxy-pattern/</guid>
      <description>Classification: Structural Pattern(Proxy), Creational Pattern(Lazy Initialization)
Find the code example here.
In this pattern, we create a proxy for the original class that we are trying to use. This class will have all the methods(which we are interested in) of the original class and may or may not have extra methods. When we say proxy has the methods of original object, we mean the method signature. So using proxy object will be similar to using the real object.</description>

Now when I look at the code that I&amp;rsquo;ve written(after reading the Design Patterns) I can see that I have unknowingly put some of the Design Patterns I had read about into the code I have done! Wow! :) Since it has helped me to code better I have decided to learn/revise atleast one new pattern once in a few days(or weeks for that matter ;) as am a bit lazy!</description>

I thought it was meant for Enterprise applications usage like Transaction management, logging etc. But recently I was faced with a problem - how to know an Object&amp;rsquo;s state changes in Java. As you know state of an Object is its properties, so what I want is to know when the state changes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get what to do about it, and so posted in stackoverflow.</description>

      <description>On 2nd of March, we (a group of 10 friends) went onto the famous Agastyakoodam(or Agastyarkoodam as some call it that way). It is the second tallest hill in the Western Ghats. The tallest one is Anamudi. The only way to reach the top of Agastyakoodam is a 24km trek (although forest gaurds say it is only 18km). Of this only the last 6km include the flight to the hill. The remaining 18km(or 12km if you believe the forest gaurds) is through dense forests which comprise the Agastyakoodam Biosphere reserve.</description>

      <description>Download the app from PlayStore On January 6th early morning(at about 3 AM), I created my Google Developer account, and published my first Android app - Thulika Keyboard - in the Play Store. Thulika Keyboard is a Handwriting recognition keyboard. It is the first app that brings handwriting recognition to an Indian Language(Malayalam for the time being!). User writes a single symbol, the app recognizes it and may give a possible list of suggestions.</description>

      <description>Before you read :Indian languages use complex script unlike English letters. Each English letter is composed of a single Unicode letter. But each letter of Indian languages may be composed of more than one Unicode letters.
The decomposition is as follows: LetterCode + modifyingSymbolCode
Eg: ക്രൊ = ( ക + ്ര + ൊ )
So as you see the code that comes first(ക) need not be the first letter that the user writes(െ).</description>

      <description>We planned to start to Kanyakumari from Thiruvanathapuram(tvm) by 5 AM so that we could see the sun rise at India&amp;rsquo;s southern-most tip. But as usual, we got delayed! And we left by about 5.45AM. Our rides consisted of my Fz and a friend&amp;rsquo;s Hunk. There were 4 of us - Arun Elias, Dhanoop Bhaskar, Basil Kuriakose and myself.
We rode through Kanyakumari-Panvel road. We reached Neyyattinkara and had breakfast from a small hotel.</description>

      <description>Learning OpenGLES 2.0 is easier on Android than on iOS because we can directly focus on OpenGLES implementation rather than wasting time on making the EGL bingings working properly. EGL stuffs are taken care of by android.opengl.GLSurfaceView.
OpenGL ES2.0 API is provided by &amp;lsquo;android.opengl.GLES20&amp;rsquo; package.
The naming convention sticks to the C version. Functions are implemented as static in GLES20 package. So they can be called like GLES20.function_name(). For example, the mappings are as follows from C to the Android Java version:</description>

      <description>Woke up today (actually yesterday as its past 12 midnight) to hear the news of Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo; death. The news about the death of a man whom I consider one of my role models actually left a kind of pain. Yup, I felt sad, as if someone I knew had died :(

Second fell on Newton

      <description>When using Netbeans to create Java projects, you might be using extra library files (jar files), for example, twitter4j-core-2.2.3.jar. The default Netbeans packaging excludes these library files when you build the project. This will result in missing class files when you run the jar file. To prevent this we can add the jar files itself as part of the final application. For this do as follows:
  Add the library jar files into a folder within the project, say /lib</description>

      <description>Just happened to read some &amp;lsquo;nerdy&amp;rsquo; jokes here.
My favourite ones (credit goes to their respective creators):
 there is a physicist, a biologist and a mathematician standing in front of a house. They see one man enter and two men leave.
The Physicist says, &amp;ldquo;Well there is obviously an unknown variable.&amp;rdquo; The Biologist says, &amp;ldquo;The man must have multiplied.&amp;rdquo;
The mathematician then looks at them both and says, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it happened but if one more person enters the house it will be empty.</description>

      <description>Last day I managed to install Mac OS X Snaow Leopard 10.6 from the original retail DVD on my Dell Inspiron 1525. And to my astonishment it was pretty easy! - even though it took me 3 trials to get the hang of it :) After that I also updated it to SL version 10.6.5 :D
I followed the excellent guide available here. Take a print out of this guide and then do as follows:</description>

      <description>Last day, I happened to read about Android programming. I also tried their &amp;lsquo;Hello Android&amp;rsquo; program. I was really surprised (and happy) to know that Android programming is done in Java. That means I don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn any new languages. (Ofcourse we can program in C/C++, but thats a different case). But Android doesn&amp;rsquo;t use JVM to run these programs, instead it uses another VM called Dalvik VM. All android programs are under the control of this VM.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo; is used to produce output files from several input files, although it is more usually used to compile programs.
This is a very short note of &amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo; utility, mostly made for my own reference :). The best way to study is to look at makefiles! &amp;lsquo;Beginning Linux Programming&amp;rsquo; by Neil Matthew and Richard Stones is a good book to start linux programming. It also mentions &amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo; utility.
&amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo; searches for a file &amp;lsquo;makefile&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Makefile&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I just published my BTech miniproject - 8085sim, an 8085 simulator - on Sourceforge. Download it from here -http://sourceforge.net/projects/j8085sim/To get a valid name I added a &amp;lsquo;j&amp;rsquo; (short for Java) before the name, so it is now &amp;lsquo;j8085sim&amp;rsquo;.
This project is the result of about 5 weeks work by me and my team mates - Jinsmon Kurian and Deepu Devassy. Since the project demo is over, I believe this software should now be released.</description>

      <description>[UPDATE] The BSNL site design has been changed. So this program won&amp;rsquo;t work. I suppose only a small change is needed. Will try to update this post with the new link as soon as I find time for making necessary changes.[UPDATE]
What is the advantage of knowing a scripting language? It helps you to automate much of the boring tasks that you do on a day-to-day basis.
I was fed up of logging in, clicking a series of links and finally logging out from BSNL&amp;rsquo;s website (to be exact www.</description>

      <description>I took out some time to create a simple videocutter and converter. Its actually just a front-end to ffmpeg, so you require ffmpeg to run it. Download videoCutter.
Why did I make this? Isn&amp;rsquo;t there any other good video converter or cutter? Oh ya, there are many. One of the good ones I have found is WinFF which is also a front-end to ffmpeg. But I don&amp;rsquo;t need all those complex functions to just convert a video.</description>

      <description>GCC - GNU Compiler Collection
From GCC manual - When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.Compile and Link a simple program: gcc -o hello.out hello.c This creates an executable &amp;lsquo;hello.out&amp;rsquo; from file &amp;lsquo;hello.c&amp;rsquo; -o specifies the output file.
Specify Language: Create a C file and save it as &amp;lsquo;hello.cpp&amp;rsquo;.
gcc -o hello.out hello.cpp This results in an error as gcc tries to perform C++ compilation(assumed from the extension .</description>

      <description>Decided to keep the default title for the first post.So &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; :)
Have started three/four blogs in the past. But couldn&amp;rsquo;t stick with them. Atleast i think i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t abandon this one. First reason is i got this blog with my name. And the second one is i really get a feeling that i should be sincere with this one. And the third one is &amp;hellip; hmm.. oops.. no third one.</description>
